trace_reader is used to parse the trace generated by tracecap.

Building tracecap:

1. Go into the DECAF source and make the llconf library. This library 
  is used by the tracecap plugin to parse its .ini config file. Assuming
  that you cloned the DECAF repository into the home directory of the
  user "user", you'll now have the directory /home/user/DECAF that contains
  DECAF and DroidScope. Change into the llconf source directory and build:

  cd /home/user/DECAF/decaf/shared/llconf
  ./configure
  make

2. Build DECAF with whatever configuration settings you need via the 
  DECAF configure script:

  cd /home/user/DECAF/decaf
  ./configure
  make

3. Go to tracecap plugin directory and configure and build it:
  cd /home/user/DECAF/decaf/plugins/tracecap
  ./configure --decaf-path=/home/user/DECAF/decaf
   make

The tracecap.so plugin is now located in the plugins/tracecap directory.
